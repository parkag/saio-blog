This year my [proposal]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/SAIO-gsoc-proposal.pdf) was accepted into prestigious global program Google Summer of Code 2015. 

During the summer I will be working on refining the existing experimental simulated annealing approach to optimize join orders for large queries in Postgres database.

The project is under the mentorship of Atri Sharma :)   

This is going to be very interesting and exciting summer!
